*Welcome to rockonmod!*

This is my first minecraft forge mod. Project started on August 9th, 2022.\
I created this mod mainly to learn more about java and game modding in general. Feel free to play with the mod :)\
Programmed with Official Mapping instead Snapshot mapping.\

**Features new items:**
- Amethyst (item): (mainly for tab icon lol)
- Rice (food): Increase nutrition and saturation
- All Effect (food): Get total 26 effect for "How Did We Get Here?" achievement for 10s
- First Aid (food): Healing hearts in 10s
